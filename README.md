# MDE4CPP Profiling & Benchmarking Examples

This repository contains the **modeling examples and benchmarking experiments** developed for the research project *"A Comprehensive Analysis of Profiling Strategies and Performance Benchmarking with MDE4CPP"* (TU Ilmenau, 2025). https://github.com/MDE4CPP/MDE4CPP

## Purpose
The repo demonstrates:
- **Ecore4CPP models**: Sample meta-models with classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
- **UML4CPP models**: UML-based applications designed in Papyrus and integrated with C++.
- **Profiling experiments**: Execution time, CPU usage, and memory utilization measurements for model creation, manipulation, and traversal.
- **Benchmark scripts**: Configurations used to evaluate performance across different profiling tools (gprof, Visual Studio Profiler, Intel VTune).

## Goal
To provide reproducible examples of how profiling strategies can be applied to **MDE4CPP-based applications**, enabling performance analysis and optimization of Ecore and UML meta-models.

This repository complements the research project report and serves as a practical reference for students and developers exploring **profiling, optimization, and benchmarking in model-driven engineering with C++**.
